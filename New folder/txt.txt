Data cleaning steps includes removing of dataset with partition information like unavailable 12th or graduation marks.

key Difference 
k-mean algorithm minimizes the total squared error where as k-medoids minimizes the sum of dissimilarities between points labeled to be in a cluster.
K-mean cluster center (known as centroid) may or may not be part of dataset wereas k-medoids chooses its center(medoids) from the data set.
commputational time complexity


Advantages:

It is simple to understand and easy to implement.
K-Medoid Algorithm is fast and converges in a fixed number of steps.
PAM is less sensitive to outliers than other partitioning algorithms.
Disadvantages:

The main disadvantage of K-Medoid algorithms is that it is not suitable for clustering non-spherical (arbitrary shaped) groups of objects. This is because it relies on minimizing the distances between the non-medoid objects and the medoid (the cluster center) â€“ briefly, it uses compactness as clustering criteria instead of connectivity.
It may obtain different results for different runs on the same dataset because the first k medoids are chosen randomly.


Educational data is much prone to anomalies and k-Medoid clustering algoritm provides better result in clustering the data taking account those anomalies.
Drawback k-Medoid gives different reults but results are very closed enough to neglect .The difference due to outlier if huge and cannot be ignored 
as can let to complete removal of cluster by kmeam algorithm whereas k-Medoid still able to classify into good and bad
